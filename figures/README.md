# Figures
Relevant figures concluding my thesis. 

## Slide1.png - slide7.png
These figures indicate the GMF of the evoked potentials (EP), as well as the topoplots at the indicated timepoints of the EPs. 

## Fieldtrip pipeline.png
This figure shows an overview of the pipeline that I developed, using EEG, MRI and/or CT images as input, to finally get the dipole locations, magnitude and orientation as outputs using EEG source reconstruction.
