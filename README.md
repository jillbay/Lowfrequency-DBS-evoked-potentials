# Lowfrequency-DBS-evoked-potentials
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Master's thesis in Biomedical Signals &amp; Systems, focusing on EEG analysis and source localization of deep brain stimulation (DBS) evoked potentials.

# Goals
- Perform EEG source reconstruction using patient-specific FEM-based head models
- Investigate the temporal progression of evoked responses
- Explore whether distinct spatial or temporal characteristics of the evoked activity could serve as biomarkers for predicting clinical response to DBS treatment in epilepsy
